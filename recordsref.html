			<h3>Helpful Tips:</h3>
			<h3>Scanning to Someone’s Desktop</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the fax machine</li>
				<li>Press the Scan button on the fax machine</li>
				<li>Click on the box where a phone number would appear. A menu should open up upon being clicked</li>
				<li>Look up the desired individual whom you are scanning to. Click on it</li>
				<li>Press send</li>
				<li>Confirm with the desired individual that it was received</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>Quick Notes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>When we receive records from other facilities, start a <b>NEW</b> quick note. Write in where the records came from and whose mailbox they will be going into for review.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Ex) “Received medical records from Boston Medical Center. Put in Dr. Williams’ mailbox for review.” Sign and sign off on the note.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>CD Records</h3>
			<p>CD Records come on CDs. You will know that a CD is a CD Record because it will have the patient’s name and D.O.B written on it</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Put the CD into the computer</li>
				<li>A popup will appear on the screen asking if you want to open the files. Click on Open File.</li>
				<li>Once the file is open, print <b>ALL</b> of the paged on the CD</li>
				<li>Go into EMR and check the patient’s chart to see who the PCP is. Document in a quick note where the records came from and which PCP’s mailbox the records will be going into for review</li>
				<li>Place a sticky note on the front page of the printed records with the PCP’s name, the patient’s name, and the patient’s D.O.B. written on it. Place the printed records in the correct PCP’s mailbox.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Scanning</h3>
			<p>Reasons to Scan:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Scan what has been faxed with its fax success sheet (the fax cover sheet and the document that was sent back to let us know if the fax was a success or a failure.)</li>
				<li>Scan in documents that are regarding current or old patients. If something was sent to us for a patient that was never seen at one of our locations, send the document back. Confirm that you received a fax success sheet and then put both the original document and the success sheet in the shred pile. No need to scan it in.</li>
				<li>If you are mailing out records and are sending the release form in the envelope, scan the release form before putting it in the envelope.</li>
				<li>Do not scan in records that were printed from EMR. Only scan in the cover sheet, the release form, and the fax success sheet if that is the case.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>Billing</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Our Billing Department’s phone number is <b>781-338-7170.</b> Usually this will be needed if a lawyer’s office calls and states that they have received the medical records but not the bills. Apologize for the inconvenience and provide the lawyer’s office with the Billing Department’s phone number for them to follow up with.</li>
				<li>Release forms may come where both medical records and bills are requested. This is usually the case with lawyer’s offices. Sometimes the requests might be on two different release forms, but if not then take the release and scan it to Krystal’s desktop from the fax machine.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Phone Notes</h3>
			<p>These are used when patients, insurance agents, lawyers, government officials, etc. call the office in regards to a medical records request.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Describe in detail what was said over the phone in the phone note.</li>
				<li>If the conversation requires a call back, hold the phone note to your desktop. In order to ensure this, make sure that your name appears where it says Provider. Hold the document to yourself.</li>
				<li>If the conversation does not require a call back or if 2-3 weeks have passed with no call back, sign off on the phone note.</li>
				<li><i><u>Important:</u></i> Call back whoever has called at least three times and leave a voicemail each time. Do not make all three phone calls in the same day. In a phone note, document that you called. If after three calls no one has returned your call, sign off on the phone note.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Logging</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Every time we send out medical records that include Immunizations, Medication Lists, and a Chart Summary, it must be logged.</li>
				<li>There is a folder in the Medical Records folder called <i>Carla’s Medical Records Request Log.</i> In this folder you will find folders labeled by year.</li>
				<li>Click on the folder that says 2019 requests. Once you open that folder you will see folders for each month. Click on the current month.</li>
				<li>A word document will open up. This is where you will document:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Patient’s name</li>
					<li>D.O.B.</li>
					<li>Date of request</li>
					<li>Reason for request</li>
					<li>Date of completion of request</li>
				</ul>
				<li>If a request was mailed, indicate that it was mailed in the box for ‘date of completion.’</li>
				<li>Be sure to save before exiting the document.</li>
				<li><b><u><i>Make sure to count the number of requests that are completed within the span of each day and log that number in the Daily Number of Records grid</i></u></b></li>
			</ul>
