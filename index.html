<!-- at some point i should start working on a phone script if they have me do phones again. im garbage at phone calls. a script might help -->
<!-- in that vein, instructions on how to do medical records would be great. next time eileen has me do some, i should write down the instructions for how to do it and what to do and not do when doing it -->
<!-- is there any way I could save documents to here if I have an idea during work so that I don't have to keep writing them on sticky notes and disregarding them later? that'd be cool -->
<!-- if that were the case, then i could add in how i labeled a specific document that i keep forgetting how to label. like: brief description of the document, what it's filed under, and what I called it.
that'd be really nice bc then I could refer back to it. -->
<!-- tagging system? -->
<!-- it would be a good idea to have phone numbers and stuff saved here :') -->
