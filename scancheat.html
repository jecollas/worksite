  <p>When you’re scanning, you want to keep in mind that someone (maybe you, maybe someone else) is going to be responsible for the importing. Here is a list of some little things that you could do while scanning to make the importing process a little easier.</p>

	<ul>
    <li>Organize documents by type. It’s a little more difficult when there are hundreds of documents to sort through or if there’s a wider variety in the stack, but it’s doable and it makes importing that much easier. For example, you could break up your scanning into sections of:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Rx’s</li>
      <li>EKG’s</li>
      <li>Physician’s Orders</li>
      <li>Immunizations</li>
      <li>Consult Notes (Dermatology, Orthopedic, Urology, Hematology/Oncology, etc.)</li>
      <li>Patient Profiles (put all of the patient profile documents together into one document: Patient Profile, Preventive Care Visit and Copays, TMCCC Responsibilities, etc.)</li>
      <li>Consent Forms (Medical Records Request, Medication Administration Consent Form, Immunization Order and Consent Form, TB Screening Questionnaire Order Consent and Record)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Scan 25, import 25.  That’s just protocol.</li>
    <li>Make sure that all the information you need to import the document is clearly visible</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Patient Name, DOB, Physician, Clinical Date, Document Type, etc.</li>
      <li>Sometimes there are documents that don’t include a patient name, a DOB, or both.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>If there is a fax cover and/or a success sheet attached to the document, put it at the back of the document</li>
    <li>If a document is just a success sheet, don’t scan it at all. Either put it in shredding or make sure that it goes with the document that it belongs with.</li>
    <li>Make sure the document that you are scanning only corresponds to one patient. If it’s a document that contains multiple patients, either split it up into multiple documents or make copies block out any patient information that doesn’t pertain to the patient for whom you are scanning.</li>
    <li>Why do any of this?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Taking a look at the documents before you scan them gives you a better idea of what’s there and gives you more time to figure out what goes where</li>
      <li>It is easier to import a document when the first thing that you see is the important information and not just a fax cover.</li>
      <li>Breaking scanning up into groups of 25 makes importing less stressful. Importing a bucket of 157 documents sounds like a daunting challenge. Importing six blocks of 25 (plus a couple of extras) is so much easier to handle. There’s a reason why it’s protocol.</li>
      <li>Decreases the potential for HIPAA violations.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
